# Conversion playbooks for Ansible

These are some Ansible playbooks that can convert markdown and RST to asciidoc. Other conversions are possible too.

## Conversion tools

Besides Ansible you need additional packages to handle the actual conversion.
You can use `pandoc` for all types.
For markdown to asciidoc, [kramdown-asciidoc](https://github.com/asciidoctor/kramdown-asciidoc#kramdown-asciidoc-markdown-to-asciidoc) is preferred because the `kramdoc` tool is part of the Asciidoc toolchain.
